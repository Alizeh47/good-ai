I'll provide a detailed documentation for setting up a modern jewelry e-commerce website similar to Eglanto using Next.js with App Router and TypeScript.

# Technical Documentation: Jewelry E-commerce Website

## Core Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework
- Next.js 14.x (with App Router)
- TypeScript 5.x
- React 18.x

### Styling & UI
- Tailwind CSS 3.x
  - Custom color palette setup (observed: neutral, teal-900, amber-700)
  - Custom fonts (similar to: Unna for headings, Inter for body text)
- Framer Motion (for animations observed in the reference)
- Tailwind Configuration:
  - Extend theme colors for brand-specific palette
  - Custom container settings for layout
  - Custom breakpoints matching the design

### State Management & Data Fetching
- Zustand (for global state management)
  - Cart management
  - Wishlist functionality
  - User preferences
- React Query/TanStack Query
  - Product data fetching
  - Category management
  - Reviews system

### Image Optimization & Media
- Next.js Image component
- React Player (for video content in hero section)
- Sharp (for image optimization)

### UI Components & Libraries
- Lucide Icons (for consistent iconography)
- Shadcn/ui
  - Dialog components
  - Navigation menu
  - Card components
  - Form elements
- React Hook Form (form management)
- Zod (form validation)

### Development Tools
- ESLint
  - @typescript-eslint
  - eslint-config-next
  - prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
- Prettier
- Husky (pre-commit hooks)
- Commitlint

### Analytics & Performance
- Google Analytics
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Sentry (error tracking)

### SEO & Metadata
- Next SEO
- Schema markup for products
- Sitemap generator

### Testing
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Cypress (E2E testing)
- Playwright (cross-browser testing)

### Build & Deployment
- Vercel (recommended for Next.js)
- Environment configuration
  - Development
  - Staging
  - Production

### Security
- Helmet.js (security headers)
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Content Security Policy

### Internationalization
- next-i18next
- Language detection
- RTL support

### Performance Optimization
- Next.js built-in optimizations
- Lazy loading components
- Image optimization
- Bundle analysis
- Code splitting

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers
- Progressive enhancement
- Fallback strategies

## Additional Considerations
- Implement responsive breakpoints matching the design
- Set up a proper color system in Tailwind config
- Configure custom fonts through Next.js font optimization
- Implement proper image lazy loading strategies
- Set up proper meta tags for SEO
- Configure proper security headers
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Set up proper logging system

This documentation reflects the requirements needed to achieve the elegant, performant design shown in the reference images while maintaining modern development practices and standards.
